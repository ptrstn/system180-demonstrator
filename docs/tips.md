Absolutely. Converting your model to **float16 (FP16)** is one of the **most effective ways** to drastically improve inference speed *and* reduce GPU memory usage on the Jetson Orin Nano. And yes ‚Äî **TensorRT supports float16 natively** and performs far better with it on Jetson.

## ‚úÖ Summary: Why Use FP16?

| Precision | GPU Speed  | GPU Memory | Accuracy    |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `float32` | slow       | high       | perfect     |
| `float16` | **fast** ‚úÖ | **low** ‚úÖ  | \~same ‚úÖ    |
| `int8`    | fastest    | lowest     | degraded ‚ö†Ô∏è |

## üîß How To Convert YOLO to TensorRT with FP16

Assuming you have your `.pt` model (`system180custommodel_v1.pt`) and you want to export it as a **TensorRT engine with FP16 precision** at 320√ó320 (or 640√ó640 if you must):

### 1. Re-export using Ultralytics CLI (recommended)

```bash
ultralytics export model=system180custommodel_v1.pt format=engine device=0 imgsz=320 half=True
```

Or for 640√ó640:

```bash
ultralytics export model=system180custommodel_v1.pt format=engine device=0 imgsz=640 half=True
```

‚úÖ This will:

* Optimize for TensorRT
* Use float16 weights and activations
* Save `.engine` file in the same directory

You‚Äôll see a message like:

```
Export complete (FP16): system180custommodel_v1.engine (34 MB)
```

---

### 2. Use that engine in your app

Make sure your `main.py` points to the newly generated `.engine` file:

```python
YOLO_ENGINE_CENTER = "/home/sys180/models/system180custommodel_v1.engine"
```

‚úÖ And ensure `imgsz` in your `model.predict(...)` **matches** the input size you exported with (`320` or `640`).

---

### 3. Optional: Confirm FP16 mode is active

If you want to verify the engine uses float16:

* It should be smaller than the FP32 version (check file size: \~30‚Äì40 MB instead of 70‚Äì100 MB).
* You can inspect the logs when loading in TensorRT:

  ```python
  from ultralytics import YOLO
  model = YOLO("system180custommodel_v1.engine")
  print(model.overrides)
  ```

  Should show `'fp16': True` or something equivalent.

## üß™ Performance Gains from FP16

On Jetson Orin Nano:

| Model Type              | Size         | FPS              | Notes                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| PyTorch `.pt`           | 60 MB        | \~5‚Äì10 FPS       | Not optimized            |
| TensorRT `.engine` FP32 | 100 MB       | \~15‚Äì20 FPS      | Large and slower         |
| **TensorRT FP16** ‚úÖ     | **30‚Äì40 MB** | **30‚Äì60+ FPS** ‚úÖ | Best performance/latency |

When combined with:

* **`skip_frames = 5‚Äì10`**
* **Image size = 320√ó320**
* **Batching (if needed)**

‚Ä¶you can easily run inference in real-time **with GPU usage < 50%**, **no throttling**, and very low latency.

---

## üõ† Pro Tips

* Use **`half=True`** during export to enable FP16 optimization.
* Use **batching** only if your workload justifies it ‚Äî often unnecessary unless you're doing offline inference.
* Keep your image size consistent: **the `.engine` will only accept the resolution it was exported for**.
* Use `nvidia-smi` (on x86 dev) or `tegrastats`/Jetson Power GUI (on Jetson) to monitor actual load.
* Run `sudo jetson_clocks` once at boot to fix the clocks to max (disable DVFS).

---

## üö´ Don‚Äôt Try to Cast FP32 Engine to FP16 in Code

You **cannot** ‚Äúforce‚Äù FP16 at runtime if the `.engine` was compiled as FP32. TensorRT engines are **statically compiled** and only support the data types they were built with. Always re-export with `half=True`.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Command Recap

```bash
# RECOMMENDED: Float16 engine for Jetson, input 320√ó320
ultralytics export model=system180custommodel_v1.pt format=engine imgsz=320 device=0 half=True

# Optional: for 640√ó640
ultralytics export model=system180custommodel_v1.pt format=engine imgsz=640 device=0 half=True
```

Then update your `main.py` to match the input size, and you‚Äôre done ‚úÖ

---

Would you like me to regenerate a version of your `main.py` inference class that assumes FP16 + 320√ó320 with these optimal settings pre-filled?
